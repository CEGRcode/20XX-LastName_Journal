Make sure you also check the [Publication Checklist](https://github.com/CEGRcode/labtutorial/blob/master/docs/PublicationChecklist.md) for other todo items and considerations as you make your publication-specific repository.

## Step 1: Create a Repository using this template

Github has [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for using templates.

### IMPORTANT!! Github repo naming consistency
Please make sure you follow the `Year-LastName_Journal` format in naming.

## Step 2: Replace this `README.md` with `README_template.md`
Update information in the template with manuscript information and replace this file with it. You should also append setup instructions at the end of this file (after abstract).

## Step 3: Happy Coding!
Build out your scripts keep your files organized! We included a suggested file structure to help you get started but you may need to adjust based on the needs of your analysis. Just make sure that your directories include descriptive READMEs about the contents of each directory.
