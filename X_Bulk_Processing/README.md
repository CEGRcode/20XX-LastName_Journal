This directory contains scripts to pileup every BAM file against every RefPT BED file and saves the analysis to `20XX-LastName_Journal/X_Bulk_Processing/Library`.

Please make sure your BAM files are downloaded and indexed in the appropriate directory (`data/BAM/`) with normalization factors calculated (`data/BAM/NormalizationFactors/`).

See `00_Download_and_preprocessing` to read more.
