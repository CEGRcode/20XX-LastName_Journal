This directory contains scripts to pileup every BAM file against every RefPT BED file and saves the analysis to `2022-Mittal_SAGA/LIBRARY`.

Please make sure your BAM files are downloaded and indexed in the appropriate directory (`data/BAM/`) with normalization factors calculated (`data/NormalizationFactors/`). RNAseq data is expected to be aligned and saved to (`data/BAM`).

See `00_Download_and_preprocessing` to read more.
